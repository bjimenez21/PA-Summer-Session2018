  <p>To be able to research for this article I had to watch several ads before I could watch what I was looking for. I googled several terms like: Internet Ad Algorithms, Ad Algorithms, Ad Targeting, and Ad Targeting Algorithms, which to google seemed to mean I was searching for algorithms that deliver the most relevant and clickable ad. So much so that when I was on YouTube hours later casually watching videos, a lot of the adverts played to me were centered around advertising and marketing services. By recording and analyzing my recent behavior, YouTube’s algorithm has done its job.
  </p>
  <p>This process is summarized in CGP Grey’s Video, This Video Made $2,167 at Auction. How Ads Work on YouTube. (Post-Adpocalypse Updated Estimate), which talks about how necessary algorithms on sites as large as YouTube, Google and Facebook to be able to deliver the best bots are and the complex factors that go into these algorithms. The complexities of building advert targeting algorithms are explained in the Tech Crunch article, Ad Targeting is Hard, which talks about the need of a lot of data on its users to the need of a large network of systems and the need of skilled Artificial Intelligence specialists. The larger implications of these algorithms are then explored in Zeynep Tufekci’s TED Talk, We're Building a Dystopia Just to Make People Click on Ads, who argues that the lack of transparency and intrusive nature of these systems means that we are in an era where our personalities are being studied to the point where companies can possibly exploit this knowledge to sell products as well as the danger of having companies store so much information on our lives.
  </p>
  <p>One can see the ethical implications of such systems from a mile away. By using internet services that can gather that much information, we are providing data on the minute details of our lives that we ourselves might fail to notice. In giving this information to companies, can we assure ourselves that we can truly feel private. By constantly creating and updating profiles on its users, companies can push to advertise on more specific and harder to detect target groups. Adverts algorithms that can skew opinions, push for hateful groups or prey on the vulnerable are growing stronger and smarter, possibly decribing the full sacrifice of our own thought and replacing it with the hopes and needs that companies and organizations want us to have.
