  <p>To be able to research for this article I had to watch several ads before I could watch what I was looking for. I googled several terms like: Internet Ad Algorithms, Ad Algorithms, Ad Targeting, and Ad Targeting Algorithms, which to google seemed to mean I was searching for algorithms that deliver the most relevant and clickable ad. So much so that when I was on YouTube hours later casually watching videos, a lot of the adverts played to me were centered around advertising and marketing services. By recording and analyzing my recent behavior, YouTubeâ€™s algorithm has done its job.
