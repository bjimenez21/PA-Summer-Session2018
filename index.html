  <p>Hi I am Bryan Jimenez, I am currently a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. My github page is <a href="https://github.com/bjimenez21"> linked here</a>.</p>

  <p class="headers"> <strong>Bio</strong> </p>
  <p>I was born on May 29th, 2003 in the city of Passaic, New Jersey to two mexican immigrants. I attended public school for elementary and middle school but through NJSEEDS, I could apply to Phillips Academy as a 9th grader. I am currently attending PA, and at the writing of this site I am in my summer vacation, about to head into 10th grade. This website was originally created as part of a project for Dr. Zufelt's Summer Session Computer Science Class, meant to be a kind of portfolio to post work that I am particularly proud of. </p>
