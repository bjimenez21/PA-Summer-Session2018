(Post-Adpocalypse Updated Estimate), which talks about how necessary algorithms on sites as large as YouTube, Google and Facebook to be able to deliver the best bots are and the complex factors that go into these algorithms. The complexities of building advert targeting algorithms are explained in the Tech Crunch article, Ad Targeting is Hard, which talks about the need of a lot of data on its users to the need of a large network of systems and the need of skilled Artificial Intelligence specialists. The larger implications of these algorithms are then explored in Zeynep Tufekci’s TED Talk, We're Building a Dystopia Just to Make People Click on Ads, who argues that the lack of transparency and intrusive nature of these systems means that we are in an era where our personalities are being studied to the point where companies can possibly exploit this knowledge to sell products as well as the danger of having companies store so much information on our lives.

By constantly creating and updating profiles on its users, companies can push to advertise on more specific and harder to detect target groups. Adverts algorithms that can skew opinions, push for hateful groups or prey on the vulnerable are growing stronger and smarter, possibly decribing the full sacrifice of our own thought and replacing it with the hopes and needs that companies and organizations want us to have.
